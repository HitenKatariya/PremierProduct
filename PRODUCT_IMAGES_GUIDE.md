# Product Images Setup Guide

## Step 1: Organize Your Images

I've created the following folder structure for your product images:

```
D:\SGP-III\Premier_product\PremierProduct\frontend\public\images\products\
├── brass-fitting/
├── brass-insert/
├── panumatic-part/
├── pressure-gauge-parts/
├── air-conditioners-refrigeration-parts/
└── cable-gland-accessories/
```

## Step 2: Copy Your Images

1. **Copy your product images** into the appropriate category folders
2. **Rename them** following this pattern:
   - `brass-fitting-1.jpg`, `brass-fitting-2.jpg`, etc.
   - `brass-insert-1.jpg`, `brass-insert-2.jpg`, etc.
   - `panumatic-part-1.jpg`, `panumatic-part-2.jpg`, etc.
   - And so on...

## Step 3: Update Product Names and Descriptions

Once you have your images organized, send me:

1. **List of your image filenames** in each category
2. **Product names** you want to use
3. **Brief descriptions** for each product
4. **Prices** for each product

## Example Format:

**Category: brass fitting**
- Image: `brass-fitting-1.jpg` 
  - Name: "Brass Elbow Fitting 90°"
  - Description: "High-quality brass elbow fitting for pipe connections"
  - Price: $35.99

- Image: `brass-fitting-2.jpg`
  - Name: "Brass Tee Fitting" 
  - Description: "Premium brass tee fitting for T-junction connections"
  - Price: $42.50

## Step 4: I'll Create the Products

After you provide the above information, I'll:
1. Create a script to add all your products with the correct image paths
2. Update the database with your real products
3. Test that all images load correctly

## Current Status:

✅ Folder structure created
✅ Sample products working (for testing)
✅ **ALL YOUR PRODUCTS ADDED TO DATABASE!**
✅ **60 products successfully created:**
   - brass fitting: 9 products
   - brass insert: 9 products  
   - Air Conditioners and Refigeration Parts: 9 products
   - cable gland accessories: 10 products
   - panumatic part: 10 products
   - pressure gauge parts: 13 products

## Next Steps:

1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Database populated with your products
2. **📸 IMPORTANT:** Copy your actual product images to the folders:
   ```
   D:\SGP-III\Premier_product\PremierProduct\frontend\public\images\products\
   ├── brass-fitting/          (needs brass-fitting-1.jpg to brass-fitting-9.jpg)
   ├── brass-insert/           (needs brass-insert-1.jpg to brass-insert-9.jpg)

   └── cable-gland-accessories/ (needs cable-gland-1.jpg to cable-gland-10.jpg)
   ```
3. **🌐 VIEW YOUR PRODUCTS:** Go to http://localhost:5174/products to see them!
